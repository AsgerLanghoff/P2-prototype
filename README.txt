This programme is an extension for Google Chrome. It is functional on the website momondo.
When installed, the extension shows the environmental impact of flights when searching momondo along with extended information.
The extension gathers this information from momondo: flight time and airplane model. It then, along with numbers written in a database, calculates the CO2 emissions using a calculator made by International Civil Aviation Organisation.
To install it go the Chrome settings > Extensions > Turn on developer mode > Load unpacked extension > Add this folder.
If the website uses more than 5 seconds to load, the browser will have to be refreshed, for the extension to show.
